## Music Generator

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
1. **Install Python**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. Download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv musicgen_env
   source musicgen_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: musicgen_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required Python libraries**  
   You’ll need libraries for AI models, natural language processing, and audio file generation. Install them via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch librosa pydub gtts music21 soundfile
   ```

### **Step 2: Select a Pre-Trained AI Model**
For your project, you’ll need two types of AI models:
1. **Text-to-Lyric Generator**: To generate song lyrics based on the user’s input description. You can use a language model like OpenAI GPT-3, Hugging Face's GPT-2, or a similar open-source transformer model.
2. **Music Generator**: To create music based on the lyrics or input description. You can use a model like OpenAI MuseNet, Riffusion, or Magenta from Google.

#### Example:
- Use GPT from Hugging Face for lyric generation.
- Use Magenta’s music generation models like MusicVAE for creating melodies.

### **Step 3: Write the Text-to-Lyric Function**
Use GPT to generate lyrics based on the input description.

#### Code Example:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

def generate_lyrics(description):
    generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-2")
    prompt = f"Write a short {description} song:"
    lyrics = generator(prompt, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)[0]['generated_text']
    return lyrics
```

Test it:
```python
description = "rap about chicken nuggets"
print(generate_lyrics(description))
```

---

### **Step 4: Generate Music Based on the Lyrics**
Use MusicVAE or Magenta’s tools to create a short melody. 

#### Option 1: Using Magenta
Install Magenta to your system:
```bash
pip install magenta
```

Create a melody based on random sampling (or adjust for your needs):
```python
from magenta.models.melody_rl import melody_rnn

def generate_music():
    # Configuration for the MusicVAE or MelodyRNN model
    # This is a placeholder - adjust based on the melody generator you're using:
    # For real implementation, follow Magenta's installation and samples.
    # Return a generated raw audio sequence
    pass
```

#### Option 2: Use Riffusion (for AI Audio Loops):
Riffusion allows you to generate audio representations from descriptions.

---

### **Step 5: Text-to-Speech Lyrics (Optional)**
Convert the generated lyrics into vocals using text-to-speech. For example, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS):
```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def lyrics_to_audio(lyrics, filename="output_lyrics.mp3"):
    tts = gTTS(lyrics, lang='en')
    tts.save(filename)
    print(f"Lyrics saved to {filename}")
```

---

### **Step 6: Combine Music and Vocals into an MP3**
Use `pydub` to overlay vocals onto the music and save the combined file as an MP3:
```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def combine_music_and_vocals(music_file, lyrics_file, output_file="final_song.mp3"):
    music = AudioSegment.from_file(music_file)
    vocals = AudioSegment.from_file(lyrics_file)

    # Adjust volumes and overlay tracks
    combined = music.overlay(vocals, position=0)
    combined.export(output_file, format="mp3")
    print(f"Song exported to {output_file}")
```

---

### **Step 7: Create User Interface**
Provide a way for the user to input a description and run the program.

#### Basic Command-Line Interface:
```python
def main():
    description = input("Enter a description for the song (e.g., 'rap about nuggets'): ")

    # Lyric generation
    print("Generating lyrics...")
    lyrics = generate_lyrics(description)
    print(f"Lyrics:\n{lyrics}")

    # Music generation
    print("Generating music...")
    # generate_music() logic will generate a file "music.mp3"

    # Lyrics to audio
    print("Converting lyrics to audio...")
    lyrics_to_audio(lyrics, filename="lyrics.mp3")

    # Combine music and vocals
    print("Combining music and vocals...")
    combine_music_and_vocals("music.mp3", "lyrics.mp3", output_file="final_song.mp3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
